# [Build Apps With Intel XDK and Parse][published url]
## Instructor: [Reginald Dawson][instructor url]


This course will teach you how to build a magazine app with Parse and the Intel XDK framework.

XDK is a framework for efficiently creating HTML5 apps. XDK also comes with a drag-and-drop UI builder, an emulator and a debugging environment. In this course, we'll go over all of these tools and see how they can be used together for rapid app development.

Parse is a cloud-based database and backend infrastructure. Parse allows us to easily configure a back-end with structured data and media storage, so we can focus on the user experience.

To create our magazine app, we'll create a simple HTML interface to our Parse backend. Then, with the power of XDK, our app development will be as simple as drag-and-drop!
